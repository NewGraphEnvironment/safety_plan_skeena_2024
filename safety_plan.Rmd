<br>

The main goal of this fieldwork is to evaluate fish passage and establish baseline data through electrofishing techniques, working closely with crews from the Office of the Wet’suwet’en. We will be completing fish passage (Phase 1) and habitat confirmation (Phase 2) assessments in the Bulkley, Morice, Kispiox, and Zymoetz River watershed groups. A summary of the potential sites for fish passage assessments, habitat confirmation assessments, and electrofishing is provided in Table \@ref(tab:tab-electrofishing-sites), with kml (Google Earth) and gpx (garmin) files downloadable [here](`r knitr::asis_output(link_kml)`). 

<br>

Georeferenced pdf maps can be accessed and downloaded for each watershed using the following links: [Bulkley](`r knitr::asis_output(link_fieldmaps)`), [Kispiox](`r knitr::asis_output(link_fieldmaps2)`), [Zymoetz](`r knitr::asis_output(link_fieldmaps3)`), and [Morice](`r knitr::asis_output(link_fieldmaps4)`).

## Emergency Response Plan {.unnumbered}

New Graph's detailed emergency response procedures can be found [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/hsp/plans-and-assessments.html#emergency-response-plan-erp-and-procedures). These procedures should be reviewed and an emergency response plan should be completed for each job site. Our Emergency Response Plan template can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/hsp/blob/master/data/form_templates/ERP_template.pdf).

<br>

## Driving {.unnumbered}

We will be driving on forest service roads where it is essential to exercise caution and adhere strictly to all radio use protocols to ensure our safety. Proper communication on these roads helps prevent accidents by keeping everyone informed about vehicle movements and road conditions. Please review the [resource road safety](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/hsp/safe-work-procedures-and-practices.html#resource-road-safety) and [radio use](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/hsp/safe-work-procedures-and-practices.html#radio-use) sections of our Health and Safety plan so that everyone stays safe. 

<br>

## Field Plan {.unnumbered}

The primary objective of the fieldwork is to assess fish passage and establish baseline monitoring, using electrofishing techniques, in collaboration with crews from the Office of the Wet'suwet'en. We will be completing fish passage (Phase 1) and habitat confirmation (Phase 2) assessments in the Bulkley, Morice, Kispiox, and Zymoetz River watershed groups. Fieldwork methods will produce reports such as the [Skeena Watershed Fish Passage Restoration Planning 2023](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2023_reporting/). Additional reports can be found [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2023_reporting/executive-summary.html).


General fieldwork procedures can be found in our [Fish Passage Guidebook](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_guidebook/). We generally follow procedures in:

-   [fish passage assessments](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/land-based-investment/forests-for-tomorrow/field-assessment-for-determining-fish-passage-status-of-cbs.pdf) [@fish_passage_assessments]

-   [habitat confirmations](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/land-based-investment/forests-for-tomorrow/checklist-for-fish-habitat-confirmation-201112.pdf) [@confirmation_checklist_2011].

<br>

Presence/absence of fish, species composition/density and distribution limits can be useful for prioritizing which crossings are a best fit for fish passage restoration and help inform follow up monitoring so electrofishing and minnowtrapping may be conducted. Standard Fish and Fish Habitat Inventory Standard Field Form [Site Cards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/laws-policies-standards-guidance/inventory-standards/aquatic-ecosystems) are used to gather habitat data, and the Field Guide to these Site Cards can be found [here](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nr-laws-policy/risc/sitecard20.pdf).

<br>

We have PIT tagging equipment and could consider [tagging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CKZ9yaS5o8) fish captured at electrofishing sites to help us better understand population sizes and fish movement upstream and downstream of sites over the years.

<br>

We use digital field form using a product called [Mergin Maps](https://merginmaps.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxb2XBhDBARIsAOjDZ34oq-iMid3vRrgK1ZAkJ_yiz4aWY-LLF90PHiXzELbZIrxooV9vWKYaAgl2EALw_wcB) which syncs with QGIS. Please see our [Fish Passage Guidebook](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_guidebook/data-collection-and-field-navigation.html#mergin-maps) for instructions on how to set up Mergin Maps and use our digital field forms. Please send me your usernames and we can begin to share projects/forms.

<br>

A guide to freshwater fish id such as @mcphail_carveth1993FieldKey can be useful and can be downloaded [here](https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/documents/r13659/486FieldKeytoFreshwaterFishes1993Part1of2_1210014849226_8e248a8d30d97e6c45ef54a340babd2ffb57b14a3b16.pdf).

### Check In Procedures {-}

Call, text or inReach Tara Stark (2505059854) each morning to share the plan for the day (i.e. name of roads and sites). Check in time is before 7 pm each evening although we regularly check in throughout the day (ex. at arrival to site, 1pm and 4pm) on the inReach or by text and report position/provide updates.

<br>

#### Procedures for Failed Check-In - for Check in person {-}

Procedures are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:flow-check-in-fail). If a phone call or inReach check-in is not received by 7 PM, first send a text to the inReach units, then call or text the cell phones of field crew members. If no response, please call accommodations then personal emergency contacts to see if they have heard anything. Wait 1 hour and text inReach, text or call cell phones and personal emergency contacts and accommodations again. Repeat after 2 hours (9 pm) - if no response then notify the RCMP of a missing persons in the field.
