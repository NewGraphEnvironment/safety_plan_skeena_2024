  <desc>2.6km of bt rearing habitat.No action warranted at this crossing, although there is potential for embedding existing pipe to ensure fish passage. High habitat value upstream of crossing for 100m, then stream becomes grassy wetland with multiple braids.  Crossing fix recommendation of a 1x3 wooden box culvert is from fish passage assessment carried out in 2010.</desc>
